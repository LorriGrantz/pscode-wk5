// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

enter number x
enter number y
add number x and number y 
output the sum as z 

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

enter number as x
is number divisible by 2
if yes then it is even
if not then it is odd  

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Enter number a, number b, number c, number d, number e
add all 5 numbers
output the answer 
list answer as "this number is the sum"
divide sum by 5 
output answer 
list answer as "this number is the average" 
recognize all 5 numbers
is a<b,c,d,e 
if so, list a as smallest number
else check to see if b<a,c,d,e
if so, list b as smallest number
else check to see if c<a,b,d,e
if so, list c as smallest number
else check to see if d<a,b,c,e
if so, list d as smallest number
else check to see if e<a,b,c,d
if so list e as smallest number
list answer as "this answer is the smallest number" 
recognize all 5 numbers
is a>b,c,d,e 
if so, list a as largest number
else check to see if b>a,c,d,e
if so, list b as largest number
else check to see if c>a,b,d,e
if so, list c as largest number
else check to see if d>a,b,c,e
if so, list d as largest number
else check to see if e>a,b,c,d
if so list e as largest number
list answer as "this answer is the largest number"
